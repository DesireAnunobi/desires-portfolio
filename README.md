Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development - Module 2 Challenge - Working With CSS Challenge: Portfolio

## Description

This Module 2 Challenge was created for the Front-End Web Developer boot camp students. The website was built to teach and reinforce the basics of HTML, CSS, and Git. This week, I built a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

What I learnt?
- Core CSS skills: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variable

What makes your project stand out?
- I used a colours to make it stand out
- The footer stays in a fixed position

I encountered some challenges on the way including:
- Making the website responsive
