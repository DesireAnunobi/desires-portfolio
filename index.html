      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As an ex-teacher, I have extensive experience in multiple schools and age ranges, which has enabled me to foster several positive learning experiences. As my teaching career has come to an end, transferable skills such as my creative spark, determination, and bubbly personality will assist with transitioning into the tech industry. </p>
      <p>Additionally, my maths specialism has equipped me with the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to thrive in a multitude of roles. I have acquired a strong foundation in web development and a passion for ensuring the quality of software products. With my technical skills, attention to detail and quality assurance, I am confident in my ability to conduct both automated and manual tests to identify and rectify any bugs or issues within a software product and find solutions to ensure that the software is designed to the highest standards before being deployed to end-users</p>
